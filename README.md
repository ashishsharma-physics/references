This repo is created to host the references for personal use. However it can be accessed by anyone !!! If you're not catching hold of it, contact ashishsharma.physics@gmail.com

See the sorting of the papers in this repo is as follows:

> MBenes (Folder: Borides): Those papers having MBenes in title or worked upon inside the paper.

> TMBs (Folder: Borides): Those which contains the work on metal borides (May be 2D or bulk)

> Non Borides: Contains the work mostly on 2D materials beyond graphene (which is not on borides)

> Archived_Database: Contains old papers which are download once upon a time. Also hosts some papers which are interesting but doesn't fit into 2D regime.

> Learnings: Contains the documentation, or other scientific articles which are not based on any particular material exploring its properties.

> WebData: Contains header images sample and mylab (just in case sometime felt the urge to put it on).
